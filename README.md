# custom-bot-wrapper
 
this is a custom bot wrapper that i will be implementing in my existing and upcoming bots

it will work with MongoDB through mongoose, and Discord through discord.js as well as a few other packages

i am making this for the purpose of abstraction so that i can change one repository and have the changes in all of my bots. in the bot repo, i will simply have to import this repo as a package
